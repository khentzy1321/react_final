                    <h5> An employee is a type of worker that an employer can hire to do a specific job. Unlike contractors, which have more 
                        <br /> freedom than an employee, an employer controls what an employee does and exactly how it will be done.

The employee is hired by the employer after an application and interview process results in their selection as an employee.  <br />
This selection occurs after the applicant is found by the employer to be the most qualified of their applicants to do the job for which they are hiring. </h5>
